        My name is Ethan Deleu, I am 20 years old and currently studying a diploma of IT under coder academy! Some of my hobbies and interest include playing sports such as basketball and htting my local gym Derrimut's. I am also into playing video games and watching films. Before studying I always had a passion for computers however never got into coding so the all these new things are daunting I am very excited for what lays ahead.
